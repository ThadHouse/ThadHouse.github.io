  Welcome to Thad House's online portfolio.
  </p>
  If interested in more information and/or a resume, please email me at thadhouse1@gmail.com
  </p>
  The following is a list of many of the larger projects I have worked on and contributed to.
  For a more comprehensive list, see <a href="https://github.com/thadhouse">my GitHub Profile</a>,
  the organization for my C# robotics libraries <a href="https://github.com/robotdotnet">robotdotnet</a>,
  and the <a href="https://github.com/wpilibsuite">wpilibsuite</a> for the open source robotics project I contribute to.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b><a href="https://github.com/wpilibsuite/vscode-wpilib">vscode-wpilib</a></b>
      A VS Code extension built to allow high school robotics teams to create, write and upload code to their robots.
      Works with multiple languages (C++ and Java) by default, and is extensible.
    </li>
    </p>
    <li>
      <b><a href="https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib">allwpilib</a></b>
      The primary WPILib repo. I own and focus on the HAL subsystem, along with maintaining the build setup.
      In 2017, I rewrote and reimagined the HAL API to make it cleaner, easier to use, and more performant.
      This was my first large contribution to an external Open Source project. For the build system portion
      we currently use Gradle and CMake, with multiple custom written Gradle plugins in order to make multi
      platform builds possible.
    </li>
    </p>
    <li>
      <b><a href="https://github.com/robotdotnet/frc-utilities">C# FRC Utilities</a></b>
      A collection of tools designed to make C# programming easier, especially related to interop.
      Contains tools for detecting native libraries, and generating classes at runtime to interface
      with those native libraries in the most performant way possible.
    </li>
    </p>
    </p>
    <li>
      <b><a href="https://github.com/robotdotnet/SimpleFMS">SimpleFMS</a></b>
      An implementation of the FRC Field Management System protcol, using a distributed system of tablets
      and xamarin applications as the UI, with a custom server communicating with a custom protocol.
      I would like to rewrite this someday with modern technologies, such as Xamarin Forms, ASP.NET Core, and SignalR
      Core.
    </li>
    </p>
    <li>
      <b><a href="https://github.com/robotdotnet/frc-cli">C# FRC CLI</a></b>
      A command line utility for deploying robotdotnet code to the control system we use.
      This was an attempt to learn a bit more about unit testing, dependency injection, and mocking
    </li>
    </p>
    <li>
      <b>FRC Network Communication Library</b>
      This is a group of programs designed to implement the FRC NetComm protocol for talking between a laptop
      Driver Station, a robot control, and a field management system. This was entirely event loop
      driven with LibUV as an attempt to learn more about event loops, and building an entire system
      from the ground up. This can be shown upon request, however the repo is not public currently.
  </ul>
  </p>
  In addition, I have worked on some other projects involving the following technologies.
  <ul>
    <li>Xamarin Forms and ASP.NET Core WebAPI</li>
    <li>JNI native libraries for Java, along with starting a JVM from C++</li>
    <li>P/Invoke from C# native libraries, with a focus on fast interop and few to no allocations</li>
    <li>
      Assembly Language, and Stack Based VM languages. Taught a summer camp building a custom ISA,
      assembler, disassembler and emulator. Afterwards, taught parsing and interpeters by building
      a custom JVM.
    </li>
    <li>LabVIEW, including data gathering, and some shared library interop</li>
    <li>Gradle plugins in both Groovy and Java, with a focus on building Native Libraries in gradle</li>
    <li>Simple Windows Forms UI's, with knowledge of Async Await and threading issues with UI's</li>
    <li>
      Multithreading, with proper locking and lock free techniques, and how those interact with
      embedded platforms.
    </li>
    <li>Cross compilers for embedded linux systems, such as the Raspberry Pi, nVidia Jetson and National Instruments
      Linux Real-Time</li>
    <li>Experience with low level interfacing in NI Real-Time Linux and FPGA's, with a goal to learn FPGA and FPGA
      Interface programming</li>
    <li>OpenCV object detection experience</li>
  </ul>
