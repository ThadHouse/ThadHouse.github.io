Welcome to Thad House's online resume and portfolio.
</p>
A copy of my resume can be found at the following link. <a href="Resume.doc">Thad's Resume</a>
</p>
The following is a list of many of the larger projects I have worked on and contributed to.
For a more comprehensive list, see <a href="https://github.com/thadhouse">my GitHub Profile</a>,
the organization for my C# robotics libraries <a href="https://github.com/robotdotnet">robotdotnet</a>,
and the <a href="https://github.com/wpilibsuite">wpilibsuite</a> for the open source robotics project I contribute to.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/wpilibsuite/vscode-wpilib">vscode-wpilib</a></b>
    A VS Code extension built to allow high school robotics teams to create, write and upload code to their robots.
    Works with multiple languages (C++ and Java) by default, and is extensible.
  </li>
</p>
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib">allwpilib</a></b>
    The primary WPILib repo. I own and focus on the HAL subsystem, along with maintaining the build setup.
    In 2017, I rewrote and reimagined the HAL API to make it cleaner, easier to use, and more performant.
    This was my first large contribution to an external Open Source project. For the build system portion
    we currently use Gradle and CMake, with multiple custom written Gradle plugins in order to make multi
    platform builds possible.
  </li>
</p>
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/robotdotnet/frc-utilities">C# FRC Utilities</a></b>
    A collection of tools designed to make C# programming easier, especially related to interop.
    Contains tools for detecting native libraries, and generating classes at runtime to interface
    with those native libraries in the most performant way possible.
  </li>
</p>
<li>
  <b><a href="https://github.com/robotdotnet/frc-cli">C# FRC CLI</a></b>
  A command line utility for deploying robotdotnet code to the control system we use.
  This was an attempt to learn a bit more about unit testing, dependency injection, and mocking
</li>
</ul>
</p>
In addition, I have worked on some other projects for past employers which include the following technologies:
<ul>
  <li>Xamarin Forms and ASP.NET Core WebAPI</li>
</ul>
